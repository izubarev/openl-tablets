/**
 * The interface of the repository abstraction. It contains a minimal set of methods to be compatible with various of
 * internet storages like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage or Azure Storage. And to be simple to implement own storage
 * based on a Database or a File System. This repository does not assume that it should support transactions, sessions
 * or concurrent access. This repository must support only the atomicity of file modification, so the file always
 * contains valid data.
 *
 * All path names in the repository MUST BE relative and satisfy to the following rules:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Only '/' symbol MUST be used to separate folders</li>
 * <li>The first symbol of the path MUST NOT be started from '/'</li>
 * <li>The path to the folder MUST be ended with '/'</li>
 * <li>The path to the file MUST NOT be ended with '/'</li>
 * <li>The path to the root folder is the empty path</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Examples:
 * <ul>
 * <li>'' - the root folder</li>
 * <li>'file_name' - file</li>
 * <li>'folder_name/' - folder</li>
 * <li>'folder_name/inner_file' - file</li>
 * <li>'folder_name/inner_folder/' - folder</li>
 * </ul>
